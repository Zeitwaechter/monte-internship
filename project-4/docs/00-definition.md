# Building a(nother) Application

## To Do
- Build a(nother) Application.
	- This time, use Bootstrap 4 for CSS-basics and try to solve every step only by using Bootstrap 4 CSS classes.
	- Also build a local functionallity with Vue.js:
		- Create a ToDo-List with Vue.js that withstands CTRL+F5 (vue-localstorage package).
		- By Clicking on + you add a ToDo-Item.
		- By Clicking on - you remove the specific ToDo-Item.
		- By Clicking the (save)-Button you save the current state.
- The Mockups for the Views are included in `./mockups`.
	- `fas ...` is to be replaced with the concurrent Font Awesome Icon.
- Images can be used via [placeholder.com](https://placeholder.com/), like e.G. `https://via.placeholder.com/150` or `https://via.placeholder.com/300x150`.
- Feel free to ask about implementing Vue.
